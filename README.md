Module Eight Assignment 

This template was designed for the Gaming Room team; this client is in the process of designing a video game called Draw It or Lose It. The client wants Draw It or Lose It to be a web-based application that can be enjoyed across multiple platforms. I believe that I have excelled in creating a document that anyone could understand regardless of tech know-how. This shows the best in the evaluation section of the document. I made sure to use lamen terms and tried my best to keep everything concise. 

When designing software for the Gaming Room team, I found the Gaming Room UML the most helpful. This section helped me visualize and understand the program before writing a single line of code. 

I believe some aspects of my revisions section fall short, the primary being "Distributed Systems and Networks." I believe that adding more information to this section would have strengthened the document and would have shown a greater understanding of the material. Understanding the user's and the client's needs is paramount to being a good programmer. Without these essential skills, one will either reexplore sections of the application thought to be complete or out of a job entirely. 

When designing code for the Gaming Room team, I ensured I understood the requirements the client had expressed to me. This was best achieved by reading the provided documentation and exploring the UML diagrams. Simply understanding one way to fix a problem is great, but some clients may want things done in a specific way. When designing a similar program in the future, I think it is essential to understand the requirements fully. This can be achieved by creating UML diagrams and following industry standards within my code.
